# jsonpretty5er

A json5 prettyifier using `formatjson5`.

The source code of this repository is [literally copy-and-pasted from an example on the formatjson5 repo](https://github.com/google/json5format/blob/master/examples/formatjson5.rs).
As far as I can tell, their license gives me the go-ahead to do so. I am redistributing it like this just to make it easier to `cargo install`, because
I can't find another json5 formatter on the internet anywhere. Shrug emoji.
